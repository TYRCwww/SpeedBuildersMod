# SpeedBuildersMod
Playing Speedbuilders in Minecraft using mods

这是一个SpeedBuilders（记忆速建）模组，项目从2024年5月左右开始。
半夜突然想把之前这些事情记下来
---最初
我在23年底入坑速建，因为这个亖人圈子练习地图都不给我所以让我有了自制地图的想法，这期间到24年3月和好朋友SxcA做了一个1.20的地图，本来打算在5月10号发布，但是因为命令方块太多了所以废弃了...
之后和好朋友聊天时，突然有个想法，如果把速建变成像速通那样的模组会怎么样？
所以耗费整整三个月，这个模组就做出来了。

---制作期间
模组还在开发时，我曾找过某个国内大神帮我宣传，我想过他会拒绝，结果因为1.20等因素换来了更多的嘲讽...
本以为小圈子会更友善一点呢，可能因为这个圈子很多是PVP玩家的原因吧。

---其他
入坑速建是因为朋友给我转发国外大神在raymano的合集，当时看到国外大佬真的是特别惊讶，没想到建方块还能这么牛逼，结果后面模组开发完后，我在某个大神的评论区留言说我的模组，没想到他加了我的dc说可以给我宣传，后面发现当时的苦力怕世界纪录也是用我的模组打的真的是太炫酷了👍🏿

---关于我
前一阵模组发布已经一年了，虽然模组一直没什么人用，国外大佬也跑路了，但是真的很开心有这么一回事，记得模组内测那天来了很多人，byd还有做特别大的一个区域速建的（）
但是就像我在modrinth上面说的，在hypixel更新speedbuilders后，我发现我对速建已经不是特别感兴趣了，没有那么多的时间刷建筑，技术也上不去，所以模组也停更了...

---我曾经想做的
速建模组肯定要有服务器的实战玩法，但是因为当时不想写了所以放弃了。
如果拿速建模组开服会一些兼容性问题，导致服务器会崩溃，这个问题我相信很好解决，但是因为我不打算开服，所以我也放弃了。
我想过速建多人匹配排位模式，就像速通模组一样，因为我不能稳定花钱租服务器，所以这个也放弃了。

---最后
我希望有一天会有一个像我当时一样有这样改变圈子的想法的一个人能找到我，我可以提供模组源代码来继续完成这个普通的速建模组。
感谢所有当时来内测的玩家，感谢我的好朋友SxcA，后面不知道怎么写了。
English machine translation
This is a SpeedBuilders (Memory Rapid Construction) mod. The project started around May 2024.
One night, I suddenly wanted to record all these previous things.
--- Initially
I got into the SpeedBuilders community in late 2023 because the people in this circle didn't give me any practice maps, which made me have the idea of creating my own maps. From then until March 2024, I worked with my good friend SxcA to create a 1.20 map. I originally planned to release it on May 10th, but due to too many command blocks, it was abandoned...
Later, during a chat with my good friend, I suddenly had an idea: What if SpeedBuilders became a mod like Speedruns? 
So, after spending a full three months, this mod was finally completed. 
--- During the production period
When the module was still in the development stage, I had approached a well-known domestic expert to help promote it. I thought he might refuse, but instead, due to factors such as 1.20, I received more ridicule...
I had expected the small circle to be a bit more friendly. Maybe it's because this circle is mostly composed of PVP players. 
---Other
The rapid entry into the game was because a friend forwarded me a collection of works by a famous foreign artist on raymano. At that time, seeing the works of the foreign master was truly astonishing. I never expected that building blocks could be so amazing. Later, after the mod development was completed, I left a message in the comment section of one of the masters, saying about my mod. Unexpectedly, he added me and said he could promote it. Later, I found out that the person who was afraid of the world record at that time also used my mod to achieve it. It was really so cool 👍🏿 
--- About Me
It has been one year since the mod was released. Although the mod has not been widely used and some foreign experts have left, I am really happy about this. I remember that on the day of the mod's internal testing, many people came. Byd also set up a particularly large area for rapid building().
However, as I said on Modrinth, after Hypixel updated the SpeedBuilders, I found that I was no longer particularly interested in rapid building. I didn't have enough time to build structures and my skills couldn't improve either. So the mod has also stopped being updated... 
What I once intended to do
The rapid modeling group definitely needed to have a practical gameplay with servers. However, due to my lack of motivation at that time, I gave up on it.
If the rapid modeling group were to go online, there would be some compatibility issues, causing the server to crash. I believe this problem can be easily solved, but since I didn't plan to go online, I also gave up on it.
I also considered implementing a rapid multiplayer match ranking mode, similar to the rapid completion mod. This was because I couldn't reliably rent servers, so this idea was also abandoned. 
--- Finally
I hope that one day, someone who has the same idea of changing their circle as I did will find me. I can provide the source code of the mod to continue developing this ordinary rapid model group.
Thank you to all the players who participated in the internal test at that time. Thank you to my good friend SxcA. Later, I don't know how to continue writing.
使用源代码进行二次开发不需要得到我的同意，但是你必须在开发结束后发邮件告诉我你做了什么。
Using the source code for secondary development does not require my approval. However, you must email me after the development is completed to inform me of what you have done.
